# Magic Square Algorithm 
Description:
This README introduces the Magic Square Problem and provides a C++ implementation to generate a magic square. A magic square is a square grid of numbers where the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and both main diagonals is the same. The algorithm aims to construct a magic square for a given order (size) of the square.

Implementation:
The provided C++ implementation offers a solution to the Magic Square Problem. It employs a specific algorithm to construct a magic square for odd order and an additional approach for doubly even order. The algorithm ensures that the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same.

Data Structures:
Input Format:
The input consists of the order (size) of the magic square.
Output Format:
The output is the constructed magic square for the given order.
Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), where "n" is the order of the magic square. The algorithm involves filling each cell in the square, and the time complexity scales with the square of the order.


Graph for Time Complexity:
A graph illustrating the time complexity, particularly the relationship between the order of the magic square and execution time, can be generated using the provided instructions. This graph visually depicts the efficiency of the Magic Square algorithm for different input sizes.
