Cycle Detection Code

Overview  :

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a cycle detection algorithm. The algorithm is designed to identify cycles in a graph or linked list, which can be crucial in various applications such as memory management, resource allocation, and deadlock detection.

Features  :

1) Detects cycles in a graph or linked list.

2) Implemented in C++ for efficiency.

3) Well-commented code for easy understanding.

Time Complexity  :

The time complexity of the cycle detection algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. The algorithm uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the graph, making it suitable for graphs with a moderate number of vertices and edges.


Use Cases  :

1) Memory Management: Detecting cycles in memory structures helps identify and release unused memory blocks, preventing memory leaks.

2) Resource Allocation: In resource allocation systems, cycle detection can be used to avoid circular dependencies.

3) Deadlock Detection: Cycle detection is essential in systems with multiple processes or threads to identify and resolve deadlocks.
