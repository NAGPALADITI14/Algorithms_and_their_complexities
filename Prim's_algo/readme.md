# Prim's Algorithm README

## Description:

This README introduces Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and provides a C++ implementation to find the MST of a given graph. Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that efficiently finds the minimum-weight spanning tree for a connected, undirected graph.

## Implementation:

The provided C++ implementation offers a solution to find the MST using Prim's Algorithm. It selects the minimum-weight edge at each step to grow the spanning tree until all vertices are included, ensuring a connected and acyclic tree.

## Data Structures:

### Input Format:
- The input consists of a weighted, connected, and undirected graph represented by its adjacency matrix or an adjacency list.

### Output Format:
- The output is the set of edges forming the Minimum Spanning Tree and the total weight of the MST.

## Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(V^2) with an adjacency matrix representation and O((V + E) log V) with an adjacency list representation, where "V" is the number of vertices and "E" is the number of edges.


## Use Cases:

- **Network Design:**
  - Useful in designing efficient communication networks where connecting all locations with minimum total cable length is crucial.

- **Circuit Design:**
  - Applied in designing circuits to connect all components with the minimum total wire length.

- **Transportation Networks:**
  - Used in optimizing transportation routes to minimize the overall cost of constructing roads or railways.

This README serves as a guide for understanding and utilizing Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree. It provides users with information on the implementation, input/output formats, time complexity, graph representation, and use cases to facilitate effective usage of the algorithm in various scenarios.
