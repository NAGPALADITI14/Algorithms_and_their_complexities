# Subset Sum Problem Using Backtracking

## Description
The subset sum problem involves finding a subset of a given set of integers whose sum equals a given target sum. This implementation utilizes backtracking to find such subsets incrementally.

## Algorithm
1. **Function `sos(int* wt, int* x, int req_sum, int n, int s, int k, int rem)`**:
   - Inputs:
     - `wt`: Array of weights representing the elements.
     - `x`: Array representing the solution vector.
     - `req_sum`: Target sum.
     - `n`: Number of elements.
     - `s`: Current sum.
     - `k`: Current index.
     - `rem`: Remaining sum.
   - Recursive function that explores different subsets to find the subset with the desired sum.
   - At each step, it considers including or excluding the current element based on whether including it leads towards the target sum.
   - Prints the solution when the target sum is reached.

2. **Main Function**:
   - Takes input for the number of elements (`n`) and the target sum (`req_sum`).
   - Initializes an array `wt` to store the weights of elements.
   - Calls the `sos` function to find the subset with the desired sum.
   - Prints solutions found during the recursive search.

## Example
```
Enter the number of elements: 4
Enter the sum you want: 9
Enter elements: 
wt[0] = 3
wt[1] = 2
wt[2] = 4
wt[3] = 5
Sum = 14
Solution: 1 0 1 0 (3 , 4 , )
Solution: 1 1 0 0 (3 , 2 , )
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the subset sum problem using backtracking can vary depending on the input set and the target sum. In the worst case, where all possible subsets need to be explored, the time complexity is exponential. However, with pruning strategies like the one implemented here, the average-case time complexity can be improved.
