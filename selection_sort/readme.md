Description:
This README introduces the Selection Sort algorithm implemented in C++ through an iterative approach. Selection Sort, a simple but inefficient sorting algorithm, is explored in detail to help users understand, implement, and evaluate its characteristics.

The iterative Selection Sort version employs a non-recursive strategy, utilizing loops to repeatedly find the minimum element and swap it with the current element. This approach is more efficient for larger datasets compared to the recursive counterpart. Users can refer to the comprehensive instructions provided for compiling, running, and assessing the performance of this iterative Selection Sort implementation.

Data Structures:

The primary data structure in the iterative strategy is an integer array. The iterative process iterates through the array, finding and swapping the minimum element, gradually achieving a sorted array.

Time Complexity:
The iterative Selection Sort implementation has an average time complexity of O(n^2), where "n" is the number of elements in the array. The simplicity of the algorithm results in quadratic time complexity, making it less efficient for larger datasets.

Graph for Time Complexity:
A graph illustrating the time complexity, particularly the relationship between input size and execution time, can be generated using the provided instructions. This graph visually depicts the less efficient nature of Selection Sort for larger input sizes.

Use Cases:
1) Educational Purposes:

Selection Sort's simplicity makes it an effective tool for teaching basic sorting concepts in educational settings.
2) Small Datasets:

Suitable for sorting small datasets where the simplicity of the algorithm outweighs its inefficiency.
3) Simplicity Over Efficiency:

When a straightforward and easy-to-understand sorting algorithm is prioritized over sorting efficiency.
4) Stable In-Place Sorting:

When stable in-place sorting is required, as Selection Sort preserves the relative order of equal elements.
5) Teaching Sorting Concepts:

Ideal for illustrating fundamental sorting concepts, serving as a foundation before introducing more complex algorithms.
6) Understanding Sorting Algorithms:

Useful for individuals new to sorting algorithms to gain a basic understanding of sorting mechanics.

This README serves as a comprehensive guide, providing users with insights into the iterative Selection Sort algorithm's implementation, characteristics, and use cases. It equips users with the necessary information to apply and analyze Selection Sort in different scenarios.
