Power Algorithm 

Overview

Recursive Power Algorithm Overview
The recursive power algorithm is a method for calculating the power of a given number raised to a specified exponent using a recursive approach. It leverages the concept that the power of a number can be expressed as the product of the number itself and the power of the same number with a reduced exponent.

Iterative Power Algorithm Overview
The iterative power algorithm is a method for calculating the power of a given number raised to a specified exponent using an iterative approach. It involves repeated multiplication of the number by itself until the desired exponent is achieved.



Time Complexity
Recursive Power (Power):
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the exponent.

Iterative Power (Power):
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the exponent.

Space Complexity
Recursive Power (Power):
Space complexity: O(n), due to the recursive call stack.

Iterative Power (Power):
Space complexity: O(1), constant space usage.

Usage:

Recursive power algorithms are straightforward but may have performance implications for large exponents due to the recursive overhead.

Iterative power algorithms are often preferred for their efficiency and lower space complexity, making them suitable for scenarios with large exponents.
