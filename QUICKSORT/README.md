Quicksort Algorithm

Description:

This README introduces two distinct implementations of the Quicksort algorithm in C++: a recursive approach and an iterative approach. Quicksort, a highly efficient sorting algorithm, is explored through both strategies, allowing users to understand, compare, and leverage these implementations based on their specific needs and preferences.

Recursive Approach:
The recursive Quicksort implementation follows the classic divide-and-conquer paradigm. It efficiently sorts an integer array by recursively partitioning the array into smaller segments, sorting each segment, and then combining them to achieve a fully sorted array. The README provides guidance on how to compile, run, and analyze the recursive Quicksort, enabling users to experiment with different array sizes.

Iterative Approach:
The iterative Quicksort version employs a non-recursive strategy, utilizing a stack to manage the partitioning and sorting process iteratively. While maintaining an average time complexity of O(n log n), this approach addresses potential stack overflow issues associated with recursion. Comprehensive instructions are provided for compiling, running, and assessing the performance of this iterative Quicksort implementation.


Data Structures:

Recursive Approach:

The primary data structure utilized in the recursive approach is an integer array. Each recursive call operates on array segments, performing partitioning and sorting.

Iterative Approach:

Similar to the recursive approach, the primary data structure in the iterative strategy is an integer array. The iterative process manages the partitioning and sorting using a stack.


Time Complexity:

Both implementations maintain an average time complexity of O(n log n), making them efficient for a wide range of applications. The partitioning and sorting steps contribute to this time complexity.

Graph for Time Complexity:

Graphs illustrating the time complexity, particularly the relationship between input size and execution time, can be generated using the provided instructions. These graphs visually depict the efficiency of the Quicksort algorithm for different input sizes.

Use Cases:

Quicksort, with its versatile nature, finds applications in scenarios requiring efficient sorting. 
Both the recursive and iterative implementations are suitable for stable in-place sorting, making them valuable in handling large datasets, external sorting in databases, and parallel processing environments.

This README aims to guide users through the exploration, understanding, and analysis of Quicksort using both recursive and iterative approaches. It provides a foundation for users to tailor the implementation to their specific requirements and gain insights into the algorithm's behavior across various scenarios.
