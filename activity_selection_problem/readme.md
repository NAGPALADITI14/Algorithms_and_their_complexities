Activity Selection Problem Algorithm

Description:

This README introduces the Activity Selection Problem and provides a C++ implementation to solve it. The Activity Selection Problem involves selecting a maximum set of non-overlapping activities, each represented by a start and finish time, from a given set. The algorithm aims to maximize the number of activities performed.

Implementation:

The provided C++ implementation offers a solution to the Activity Selection Problem. It employs a greedy algorithm to select activities based on their finish times, ensuring a maximum set of non-overlapping activities.

Data Structures:

Input Format:   The input consists of a set of activities, each represented by a start time and finish time.
Output Format:  The output is the maximum set of non-overlapping activities that can be performed.


Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n), where "n" is the number of activities. Sorting the activities based on finish times is the primary contributor to the time complexity.


Graph for Time Complexity:
A graph illustrating the time complexity, particularly the relationship between the number of activities and execution time, can be generated using the provided instructions. This graph visually depicts the efficiency of the Activity Selection algorithm for different input sizes.

Use Cases:

1) Event Scheduling:  Useful for scheduling events or tasks with specific start and finish times, ensuring maximum utilization of available time.

2) Resource Allocation:  Applicable in scenarios where resources need to be allocated to activities with defined time constraints, optimizing resource usage.

3)Project Management:  Valuable for scheduling tasks in project management, maximizing the number of tasks completed within a given timeframe.

This README serves as a guide for understanding and utilizing the Activity Selection Problem algorithm. It provides users with information on the implementation, input/output formats, time complexity, graph representation, and use cases to facilitate effective usage of the algorithm in various scenarios.
