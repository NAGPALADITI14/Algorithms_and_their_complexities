# Single-Source Shortest Path Algorithm README

## Description:

This README introduces a Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithm, specifically Dijkstra's Algorithm, and provides a C++ implementation to find the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

## Implementation:

The provided C++ implementation offers a solution using Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest paths from a specified source vertex. Dijkstra's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that iteratively selects the vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source.

## Data Structures:

### Input Format:
- The input consists of a weighted directed or undirected graph represented by its adjacency matrix or an adjacency list.

### Output Format:
- The output is the shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices and the corresponding paths.

## Time Complexity:

The time complexity of Dijkstra's Algorithm is O((V + E) log V) with a binary heap or Fibonacci heap implementation, where "V" is the number of vertices and "E" is the number of edges.

## Use Cases:

- **Routing Algorithms:**
  - Applied in network routing protocols to find the shortest paths between routers.

- **Transportation Networks:**
  - Useful in optimizing transportation routes to minimize travel time.

- **Resource Allocation:**
  - Applicable in scenarios where resources need to be allocated efficiently based on distance.

This README serves as a guide for understanding and utilizing Dijkstra's Algorithm for Single-Source Shortest Path. It provides users with information on the implementation, input/output formats, time complexity, graph representation, and use cases to facilitate effective usage of the algorithm in various scenarios.
